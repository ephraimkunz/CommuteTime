# CommuteTime
Find out when the optimal time is to start your commute, taking into account traffic.

## Description
This is a simple, command-line Go program that generates graphs of possible commute times and emails them to you. Which graphs to generate and where to email them are configured with environment variables in `commute.sh`. This is called by `towork.sh` or `fromwork.sh`. Cron should be configured to call these in the morning or the night. Make these scripts executable with `chmod +x <scriptname>`.

## Costs
Be aware that the price of the Google Distance Matrix API calls used to generate the graphs are high. Each call costs 1 cent, meaning that to generate a 6 hour graph with 15 minute resolution and best, worst and likely outcomes will cost around 72 cents (6 * 4 * 3).

## Alternatives
If you don't want to set up a whole Go environment on the system where this cron job will run (i.e. Raspberry Pi), here's another way.
1. Change `commute.sh` by removing the `go build` line.
2. Cross-compile for the target machine on another machine. For Raspberry Pi, run `env GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=5 go build
`.
3. Scp this executable and the scripts to the target machine. You should be able to run the scripts there and everything should work.

## Other stuff
* You should use [Cronhub](https://cronhub.io) for monitoring your cron jobs.
